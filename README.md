#### 3. Himanshu Kumar



##### Short Description of Your Project and Objectives: 

The Spotify dataset provides rich information about various musical tracks, including their popularity, characteristics, and attributes. 
This data contains features such as track duration, danceability, energy, and loudness,
which offer valuable insights into how musical elements influence listener behavior and track popularity.

##### Objectives of the Project:

##### Identify Dataset for Analysis:
Gather raw data from different sources ( CSV files, web, etc.). Ensure that the data is relevant to the problem..

##### Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing is a key step in data analysis and machine learning that involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to make it suitable for building models. It includes handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets to ensure the model performs well.

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
The first goal is to explore the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics to understand the distribution of features like popularity, energy, and danceability. This will help uncover initial patterns and trends in the data.

##### Linear Regression:
A linear regression model will be built to predict the popularity of tracks based on their musical features, such as tempo, energy, and danceability. This will help us understand which features are the strongest predictors of a track's success.
Correlation Analysis:
Correlation analysis will be performed to identify relationships between numerical features, such as energy and danceability. This will help determine how various features are related to one another and whether they have an impact on a track's popularity.
Project Submission::
Prepare and Submit artifacts for the project - (Reports, Videos etc)
